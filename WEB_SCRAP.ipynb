        "\n",
        "HTML parsing: This method involves analyzing the HTML code of the website and extracting the relevant data based on tags, attributes, or patterns. For example, you can use HTML parsing to get the title, headings, paragraphs, links, images, etc. from a web page.\n",
        "\n",
        "DOM parsing: This method involves accessing the Document Object Model (DOM) of the website, which is a tree-like representation of the HTML elements and their attributes. You can use DOM parsing to navigate and manipulate the website dynamically using JavaScript or other scripting languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "XPath: This method involves using a query language called XPath to locate and extract data from the website based on the structure and hierarchy of the HTML elements. For example, you can use XPath to get the text of a specific element or attribute by specifying its path in the DOM tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "CSS selectors: This method involves using a syntax called CSS selectors to select and extract data from the website based on the style and appearance of the HTML elements. For example, you can use CSS selectors to get the data of a specific class or id of an element by specifying its name or value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regular expressions: This method involves using a pattern matching technique called regular expressions to extract data from the website based on certain rules or criteria. For example, you can use regular expressions to get the data that matches a specific format or pattern, such as email addresses, phone numbers, dates, etc"

It is used in web scraping projects because it can help you to display the data you collect from websites in a user-friendly and interactive way. For example, you can use Flask to create a web page that shows the results of your web scraping, such as the product information, prices, reviews, ratings, etc. from online shopping sites. You can also use Flask to create forms, buttons, links, and other features that allow the user to input the target URL and the tag to be fetched, or to download the images or files they want.\n",

It has a minimal and flexible design that lets you focus on the logic and functionality of your web scraper, rather than on the details and configuration of the web server. Flask also has a large and active community that provides many extensions and resources to help you with your web scraping project."
